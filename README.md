# Analyzing the Relationship between Global Military Expenditure and the Incidence of Military Conflicts 

## Background
During the fiscal year 1 July 2019 to 30 June 2020, the United Nations committed over $6.518 billion to sustaining [UN Peacekeeping operations](https://peacekeeping.un.org/en/what-is-peacekeeping), a multilaternal initiative which helps host countries engaged in military conflict "navigate the difficult path from conflict to peace" through a range of services including burden sharing, civilian protection, election and political process reform, and the promotion of human rights in pursuit of an overarching mandate to aid in restoring the rule of law. Despite these efforts, military spending has continued to soar globally, with total global military expenditure rising to [$1.981 trillion](https://www.sipri.org/media/press-release/2021/world-military-spending-rises-almost-2-trillion-2020) last year amid a 4.4% decline in global gross domestic product, largely attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Tasked with maintaining international peace and security, the United Nations must craft an efficient, calculated, and informed strategy with respect to deploying funds in the face of finite resources and high stakes. What insights into a nation's behavior can international policymakers and peacekeeping agencies gain from  its level of military spending? What is the relationship between military expenditure per capita and the number of military engagements a nation is involved in? What other factors correlate with the incidence of military conflicts, and how can we use them to develop a roadmap to help UN leaders refine their operations and strategy? To begin exploring answers to these questions, we'll take a look at [open data](https://www.sipri.org/databases/milex) from [The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute](https://www.sipri.org) (SIPRI) containing military expenditures per capita figures for over 160 countries from 1988-2020.
